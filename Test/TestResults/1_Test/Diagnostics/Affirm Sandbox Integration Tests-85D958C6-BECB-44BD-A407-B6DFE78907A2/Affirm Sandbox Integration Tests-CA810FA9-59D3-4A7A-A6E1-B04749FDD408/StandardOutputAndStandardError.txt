<NSLayoutConstraint:0x600002d1eb70 pleasantly-predictable-1.....height == 0.462*pleasantly-predictable-1.....height   (active, names: pleasantly-predictable-1....:0x7fb8cd8938d0 )>

Make a symbolic breakpoint at UIViewAlertForUnsatisfiableConstraints to catch this in the debugger.
The methods in the UIConstraintBasedLayoutDebugging category on UIView listed in <UIKitCore/UIView.h> may also be helpful.

Will attempt to recover by breaking constraint 
<NSLayoutConstraint:0x600002df1db0 pleasantly-predictable-1.....height == 0.462*pleasantly-predictable-1.....height   (active, names: pleasantly-predictable-1....:0x7fb8cd8ee270 )>

Make a symbolic breakpoint at UIViewAlertForUnsatisfiableConstraints to catch this in the debugger.
The methods in the UIConstraintBasedLayoutDebugging category on UIView listed in <UIKitCore/UIView.h> may also be helpful.
